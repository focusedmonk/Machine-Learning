# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains the practical implementation of machine learning concepts over multiple projects listed below.

1. [Detecting skin cancer](https://github.com/focusedmonk/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Detect%20Skin%20Cancer%20with%20Neural%20Networks) with CNN neural networks.
2. [Forecasting sales](https://github.com/focusedmonk/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Time%20Series%20Forecasting%20for%20a%20Drug%20Store) of drug stores using using variety of time-series models including ARIMA, SARIMA, VAR and VARMAX models.
3. [Tic-Tac-Toe game](https://github.com/focusedmonk/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Tic%20Tac%20Toe%20Game%20with%20Reinforcement%20Learning) with reinforcement learning.
4. Developed an application to [create custom NER](https://github.com/focusedmonk/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Create%20Custom%20NER%20Training%20Sets) from the raw data and to download the datasets for NLP model training using SpaCy library.
